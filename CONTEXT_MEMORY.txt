                           CHANGES LOG
================================================================================
(Format: [DATE] description of change)

[2026-02-27] Created CONTEXT_MEMORY.txt for persistent context tracking.
[2026-02-27] Installed Python 3.12 via uv.
[2026-02-27] Created full backend: FastAPI app, multi-provider system (OpenAI,
  Anthropic, Ollama), tool system (web search, file manager, code executor,
  datetime), conversation CRUD, WebSocket streaming, SQLite database.
[2026-02-27] Created full frontend: React + Tailwind web UI with chat interface,
  sidebar, model selector, settings panel, streaming support, markdown rendering.
[2026-02-27] Backend tested: health, models, tools, conversations endpoints all working.
[2026-02-27] Frontend builds successfully with zero TypeScript errors.
[2026-02-27] UI Reconstruction and Functional Integration:
  - Implemented macOS-style traffic light window controls and centered title bar.
  - Refined sidebar styling and navigation active states.
  - Fully integrated ActiveDialogue.tsx with useChatStore for real-time streaming chat.
  - Wired QuickActions.tsx to trigger actual assistant tasks/prompts.
  - Updated MarkdownRenderer.tsx for light-mode consistency.
[2026-02-27] Persistent Agent Management System:
  - Backend: Added Agent ORM model, Pydantic schemas, and CRUD API router.
  - Frontend: Created agentStore.ts and AgentsView.tsx for managing specialized AI assistants.
  - Integrated AgentsView into main App routing.
  - Updated HomeView's ActiveTasks to display live data from the Agent system.
  - Polished visual aesthetics (super-rounded nodes, smooth transitions, glassmorphism).
[2026-02-27] End-to-End Verification & Bug Fix:
  - Verified UI rendering, proxying, WebSocket chat streaming, and Agent CRUD.
  - Fixed 404 error on `/api/agents` endpoints. Root cause: FastAPI decorators were using `/` trailing slashes (`@router.post("/")`) which conflicted with frontend fetch calls. Changed to empty paths (`""`) to standardize against other routes.
[2026-02-27] Added Google Gemini as 4th provider. Installed google-genai SDK.
  Created gemini_provider.py, wired into config, registry, settings API, frontend.
  Added gemini_api_key to config, .env, settings panel.
  User's Gemini API key configured in .env.
  Default model set to gemini/gemini-2.5-flash.
  Available Gemini models: gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-pro, gemini-2.5-flash-lite,
  gemini-3-flash-preview, gemini-3-pro-preview.
  Tested: chat with gemini-2.5-flash works ("Hello there! Nice to meet you.")
  NOTE: Older Gemini models (2.0-flash, 1.5-pro etc) are deprecated for new users.
[2026-02-27] Fixed WebSocket 403 Forbidden: WS was mounted under /api prefix
  (actual path /api/ws/chat/{id}) but frontend connected to /ws/chat/{id}.
  Fix: Mount WS directly on app root in main.py.
[2026-02-27] Fixed stale default model references: 5 files still had "openai/gpt-4o"
  as default. Updated chatStore.ts, schemas/chat.py, schemas/conversation.py,
  conversation_service.py, models/conversation.py to "gemini/gemini-2.5-flash".
[2026-02-27] Fixed "ValueError: contents are required" from Gemini provider.
  Root cause: SQLAlchemy relationship caching bug. conversation_service.get_messages()
  used selectinload(Conversation.messages) which returned stale (empty) data from
  the identity map after add_message() committed a new message (expire_on_commit=False).
  Fix: Changed get_messages() to query Message table directly with
  select(Message).where(conversation_id==id).order_by(created_at), bypassing
  the relationship cache. Also added defensive guard in gemini_provider.py
  complete() and stream() to raise a clear error if contents list is empty.
[2026-02-27] Created CrossClaw branded Home view UI with light theme design:
  - Created 5 new home components: HomeView, ActiveDialogue, WorkspaceView, ActiveTasks, QuickActions
  - ActiveDialogue shows conversation with CrossClaw avatar and user input
  - WorkspaceView displays workflow visualization with trigger (Webhook) and actions (Summarize Text, Draft Email, Send Notification)
  - ActiveTasks shows 3 tasks with progress bars (Market Analysis 75%, Daily Summary 20%, Onboarding Support Active)
  - QuickActions displays 4 action buttons in grid: Summarize PDF, Draft Response, Find Information, Automate Task
  - Updated Sidebar to navigation menu with icons: Home, Chat, Knowledge Base, Workflows, Agents, Settings
  - Updated App.tsx with view routing system and top bar (notifications bell, document icon, settings, user avatar)
  - Updated ChatView to light theme (white background, updated colors)
  - Changed overall theme from dark purple to light gray/white with red accent for CrossClaw branding
  - Dev server running at http://localhost:5173/
[2026-02-27] Refined Home UI to more closely match user-provided reference screenshot:
  - Matched panel arrangement: Active Dialogue (with embedded Workspace panel) on left;
    Active Tasks + Quick-Actions stacked on right.
  - Updated sizing/spacing/headers to mimic screenshot proportions and visual hierarchy.
  - Wired all visible buttons in Home and top bar to functional handlers (settings/options,
    quick actions, workspace nodes/zoom controls, notifications, profile menu, etc.).
  - Added click feedback via status text so every button action has visible response.
  - Restored frontend data bootstrapping in App.tsx (loadConversations/loadModels on mount).
  - Confirmed compile success: npm run build passes (Vite + TypeScript).
[2026-02-27] Phase 6: Completed Target Match UI Design:
  - Refactored `HomeView` layout to explicitly embed `WorkspaceView` inside the `ActiveDialogue` container on the right.
  - Applied the colorful radial glowing background and transparent chat bubbles to `ActiveDialogue`.
  - Added a dotted background and updated node styles (orange, blue) to match the `WorkspaceView` mockup.
  - Hardcoded `ActiveTasks` with the precise progress bar UI ("Market Analysis 75%", etc.) and replaced the dynamic store implementation for layout fidelity.
  - Reshaped `QuickActions` to a 2x2 grid with white-buffered cards and blue icons (Summarize PDF, Draft Response, Find Information, Automate Task).
  - Thoroughly refined all padding and `rounded-xl`/`rounded-2xl` properties to ensure text legibility without edge clipping.

[2026-02-27] Phase 6.1: Real Agent Data Integration:
  - Refactored `ActiveTasks` to use `useAgentStore` and `loadAgents` for real-time data.
  - Replaced hardcoded mockup tasks with live agents from the database.
  - Verified that creating/deleting agents in the `Agents` view updates the `Home` dashboard dynamically.
  - Preserved Target Match aesthetic (green bars, status pills, sub-text info) for real entries.
[2026-02-27] Phase 6.2: UI Padding Refinement:
  - Addressed user feedback regarding text clipping on rounded corners.
  - Increased header padding in `ActiveTasks` and `QuickActions` to `px-8`.
  - Refined `AgentsView` modal with `px-12` padding and adjusted form labels (`ml-2`) to clear `rounded-[2rem]` edges.
  - Verified layout integrity across Home and Agents pages.
[2026-02-27] Phase 6.3: Brand Identity Integration:
  - Replaced the placeholder Sidebar logo with the official user-provided CrossClaw logo.
  - Asset saved to `/brand/logo.png` and integrated via `Sidebar.tsx`.
  - Verified branding consistency and visual fit.
[2026-02-27] Phase 6.4: Final UI Alignment & Scaling:
  - Corrected Sidebar logo scaling (increased to `h-14`) and top padding (`pt-12`).
  - Resolved persistent text/pill clipping by increasing right margins (`mr-4`) in `ActiveTasks` and `QuickActions`.
  - Final visual audit confirmed perfect spacing across all rounded containers.
[2026-02-27] Phase 6.5: Full Brand Logo Integration:
  - Replaced icon-only logo with the full transparent CrossClaw brand logo (`logo_full.png`).
  - Adjusted Sidebar header to `h-20` for optimal legibility of brand text and subtext.
  - Verified visual consistency and brand prominence.
[2026-02-27] Phase 7: Group Agent Chat Session:
  - Added `is_group` to Conversation model and `agent_name` to Message model via SQLite schema patch.
  - Implemented `stream_group_chat` in `ChatService` to orchestrate multiple agents (round-robin active agents taking turns up to a max limit, appending agent names to shared context).
  - Updated WebSocket connection logic to trigger `stream_group_chat` based on standard message WS packets with `is_group` flags.
  - Added `streamingAgentName` to Zustand chatStore to reliably tag active streaming chunks with agent IDs.
  - Placed a "Group Mode" toggle UI into `ActiveDialogue.tsx` allowing users to quickly start a multi-agent broadcast session.
[2026-02-28] Knowledge Base (RAG) Implementation:
  - Backend: Created Document model, DocumentService (upload, text extraction, chunking, ChromaDB embedding).
  - Created KnowledgeBaseTool for agents to search the vector store.
  - API endpoints: GET/POST/DELETE /api/knowledge.
  - Frontend: KnowledgeView.tsx with file upload and document listing.
  - Dependencies: python-multipart, chromadb, pypdf2, sentence-transformers.
[2026-02-28] Workflows Engine Implementation:
  - Backend: Created Workflow, Node, Edge ORM models. WorkflowService for CRUD + graph persistence.
  - WorkflowEngine: DAG traversal executing node actions (summarize, email_draft, notify via LLM).
  - API endpoints: CRUD /api/workflows + POST /{id}/graph.
  - Frontend: WorkflowsView.tsx with ReactFlow canvas, installed `reactflow` dependency.
  - Types: workflow.ts with Workflow, WorkflowGraph, Node, Edge interfaces.
  - API client: Added getWorkflows, createWorkflow, deleteWorkflow, getWorkflowGraph, saveWorkflowGraph.
[2026-02-28] Full UI Overhaul (6 Phases) to match user mockup images:
  Phase 1 - Home: Hub layout with Cmd+K command bar, collapsible Active Agents & Quick-Actions cards, scrollable Recent Events activity feed.
  Phase 2 - Chat: Three-pane view (conversation history left, chat thread center, context panel right with KB references and active variables).
  Phase 3 - Knowledge Base: File explorer table (File Name, Type, Status, Last Indexed, Connected Agents), filter tabs (PDF/TXT/Markdown), search bar, compact upload button, slide-out preview drawer.
  Phase 4 - Workflows: Templates gallery (Available + Suggested with "Use Template" buttons), node library sidebar (Triggers/Actions/Logic), MiniMap in editor.
  Phase 5 - Agents: Dashboard cards with SVG sparklines (Requests/sec, Latency), power toggle button, Connected Workflows toggle, slide-out config panel (replaces modal).
  Phase 6 - Settings: Tabbed left sidebar (API Keys, Local Models, Defaults), green animated connectivity indicators, Ollama connectivity tester, visual model selector with provider emoji icons.
[2026-02-28] UI Glitch Fixes (post-overhaul):
  - ChatView: Added loadConversations() on mount so thread list populates. Replaced broken Variable icon with Code2.
  - HomeView: Replaced inline calc() height with flex layout to prevent activity feed clipping.
  - ActiveDialogue: Changed command bar from absolute positioning to flex-shrink-0 so messages aren't hidden beneath it.
[2026-02-28] UI Polish Pass (from screenshot review):
  - ChatView context panel: Replaced truncated text with proper wrapping paragraph. Removed broken Code2/FileText/Variable imports.
  - AgentsView cards: Added ACTIVE/OFF status badge next to agent name. Widened sparkline SVG (80→120px, 24→28px tall). Increased label text from 9px to 10px. Removed duplicate model section from bottom. Added dedicated Model info section with label.
[2026-02-28] Home Layout Height Fix:
  - HomeView: Replaced overflow-auto + h-full (broken combo) with flex-1 flex flex-col min-h-0 chain.
    The grid now properly fills available vertical space with flex-1 min-h-0, and the activity feed
    is pinned at the bottom with flex-shrink-0. ActiveDialogue parent uses flex flex-col for height pass-through.
[2026-02-28] Agent Personality System + Tool Access:
  Backend:
    - Agent model: Added 7 columns (personality_tone, personality_traits, communication_style,
      enabled_tools, reasoning_style, memory_context, memory_instructions).
    - Schemas: Updated AgentBase, AgentUpdate, AgentOut with all new Optional fields.
    - DB migration: Added ALTER TABLE in init_database for existing SQLite DBs.
    - ChatService: Added _build_agent_prompt() to compose system prompt from personality fields,
      and _filter_tools_for_agent() to filter tool schemas per agent's enabled_tools.
      Both integrated into stream_group_chat.
  Frontend:
    - types/index.ts: Added all new fields to Agent interface.
    - AgentsView.tsx: Rebuilt slide-out config panel with 3-tab system:
      Soul (tone pills, traits multi-select, communication style, system prompt),
      Mind (tool toggle checkboxes with descriptions, reasoning style pills),
      Memory (persistent context textarea, standing instructions textarea).

================================================================================
                        THINGS TO REMEMBER
================================================================================
(User-requested notes, decisions, preferences, etc.)

- User wants all changes and file descriptions documented here.
- Always read this file at the start of a new session or when resuming work.
- Keep everything intact; do not delete previous entries.
- User emphasized again to never forget updating CONTEXT_MEMORY.txt after changes.
- **CRITICAL**: ALWAYS update this CONTEXT_MEMORY.txt after ANY code change, no matter
  how small. Update the File Inventory, Changes Log, and any other relevant sections.
  This is a hard requirement from the user. Never skip this step.
- User wants a desktop app (Electron) for controls and engagement - Phase 9 in plan.
- Gemini API key is configured in backend/.env (ASSITANCE_GEMINI_API_KEY).
- User provided a Google API key (starts with AIzaSy...) - advised to rotate after use.
- Default model is gemini/gemini-2.5-flash.

================================================================================
                        ARCHITECTURE / DECISIONS
================================================================================
(Key design decisions, patterns, tech stack choices, etc.)

- Multi-provider uses Strategy pattern + Registry. BaseProvider is the contract.
- Model strings use format "provider/model" (e.g., "openai/gpt-4o").
- Tool system uses BaseTool ABC + ToolRegistry. Tools self-describe via JSON Schema.
- ChatService has an agentic loop: LLM calls tools, sees results, loops up to 10x.
- Database: SQLite at backend/data/assitance.db (auto-created on startup).
- Frontend proxied to backend via Vite dev server proxy config.
- All CORS allowed in dev (allow_origins=["*"]).
- Settings stored in pydantic-settings (from .env), with runtime update via API.
- Persistent Agent system: Users can define specialized agents with specific system prompts and models.
- Knowledge Base uses ChromaDB for local vector storage. Documents are chunked and embedded on upload.
- Workflows use a DAG model: Workflow -> Nodes (trigger/action) -> Edges. WorkflowEngine traverses linearly for MVP.
- ReactFlow library used for visual node graph editor in the frontend.

================================================================================
                              KNOWN ISSUES
================================================================================
(Bugs, quirks, workarounds to be aware of)

- System Python installations are broken (py launcher registered but executables missing).
  Use uv-managed Python instead: uv run python, uv run uvicorn, etc.
- No API keys configured yet, so /api/models returns [] until user adds keys to
  Settings panel or .env file.
  UPDATE: Gemini key is now configured. /api/models returns 5 Gemini models.
- Electron desktop app not yet implemented (Phase 9 in plan).
- File uploads implemented via Knowledge Base (ChromaDB + document chunking).
- No Alembic migrations set up yet (using create_all for now).
- Gemini uses synchronous google-genai SDK methods (not async). The generate_content
  and generate_content_stream calls block the event loop briefly. For production,
  consider wrapping in run_in_executor or switching to async httpx calls.

================================================================================
                          REMAINING WORK (PHASES)
================================================================================
Phase 7: File Upload - DONE (Knowledge Base with ChromaDB RAG)
Phase 8: Encrypted API key storage (Fernet), persistent settings in DB
Phase 9: Electron desktop app (backend-manager, system tray, packaging)
Phase 10: Polish (error handling, loading states, logging, tests, CI)
Phase 11: Workflow execution triggers (webhook endpoint, scheduled cron)
Phase 12: Full UI overhaul - DONE (6-phase redesign matching mockups)

================================================================================
                                 END
